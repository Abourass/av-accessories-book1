**AV Accessories, Book 1**

This module contains additional assets, tiles, tokens and maps for Book One of the Abomination vaults adventure path by Paizo. There are Journals for the NPC Map handouts, the other assets you can find in the /artwork directory.

Map assets and artwork by Forgotten Adventures, https://www.forgotten-adventures.net/
Vollok token inspired by and derived from artwork by Greg Bruni, https://www.gregbrunicreations.com/
Map tiles require the module Abomination Vaults Map Remake by Narchy

I recommend using the module Multiface tiles for its tile swapping feature and ability to play/pause video tiles.

**Map Tiles**
New tile patches to place into scenes to change map based on game events – like a bridge collapsing or trap activated. (also to make a couple rooms larger on level 3)
The tiles are cropped so that they can be placed by snapping to the grid in Narchy's AV maps. They fit seemlessly.

Animated tiles (webm) showing the ghostly footprints of Otari through the abomination vaults. One video file for each floor.
